**Proud Project Employee Data Mastery**

In this project, I built a table from scratch to organize employee information. Then, I linked different pieces of data together to get a complete picture. The cool part? I didn't just stop there.

1. Data Updates
2. **Finding Ages With 'curdate,' I figured out how old each employee is. 

3. Exploring Data Values I dug into what the numbers and categories meant, getting a good feel for who's who and what they bring to the table.

4. Employee Groups With 'case else,' I grouped employees based on shared traits. It helped categorize them.

This project wasn't just about analyzing data; also creating and updating these. And I did it all using simple tools like 'create,' 'update,' 'curdate,' 'case else,' and 'subquery.' ðŸš€
